      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Free Fish Ministries — a mission founded by Jason Allbaugh and his partner Steven Hooker. What started as a simple fishing trip has grown into a calling from the Lord. We serve hot, fresh fish and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with anyone willing to listen, learn, and receive God’s love.</p>

      <p>We aim to help people overcome drug and alcohol addiction by teaching them how to build a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Through prayer, fellowship, and service, we bring hope and healing in the name of the Lord.</p>

      <h2>Where We Serve</h2>
      <p>We set up in different locations around Wakulla County. One regular spot is Shell Point, Florida — typically once a month on Saturdays and Sundays. The meals are free and so is the message of Jesus. To find out where we'll be next, just call or email us.</p>
